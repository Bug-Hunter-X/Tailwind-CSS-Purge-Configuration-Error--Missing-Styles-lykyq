The solution is to correctly configure the `purge` or `content` option in your `tailwind.config.js` file to include all the files containing your Tailwind CSS classes. Ensure that the paths are correctly set to include all relevant components and pages. 

**Correct Configuration (Next.js):**
```javascript
// tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  content: ['./pages/**/*.js', './components/**/*.js', './layouts/**/*.js'], // More comprehensive
  // ...rest of your Tailwind config
}
```

**Important Note:** Using `content` instead of `purge` is generally the recommended approach in newer Tailwind CSS versions.  It provides a more robust and less error-prone way to handle class purging.  Remember to install the necessary peer dependency for Tailwind v3:
```bash
 npm install -D postcss autoprefixer tailwindcss
```
If you're still having issues, make sure all your components and pages are correctly imported or referenced in your application.
